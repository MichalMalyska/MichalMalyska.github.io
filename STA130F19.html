<h2>Vocabulary Review:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mean</li>
</ul>
<p>Mean (also called an average, simple average, or arithmetic mean) is the sum of all elements divided by the count of all the elements.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\text{mean}(X) = \bar{X} = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \dots + X_N}{N} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( X_i \right)
\]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code># Vector of integers from 1 to 100

# Mean

<pre class="r"><code>sum(x) / length(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 50.5</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Median</li>
</ul>
<p>Median - Median is the special name we give to the 2nd Quartile / 0.5 Quantile. It is the number for which 50% of the data is below it. (Essentially the point that splits your data in half)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>median(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 50.5</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Variance</li>
</ul>
<p>Variance is the average squared distance of your datapoints from the mean. It measures how much the data is spread out from the mean.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\text{ (sample) }Var(X) = \frac{\sum\left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^2}{N-1}
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Deviation (SD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard Deviation is the average distance (deviation) of datapoints from the mean. It’s also the square root of the variance</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{ (sample) }SD(X) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum\left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^2}{N-1}} =
\sqrt{Var(X)}
\]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>sd(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 29.01149</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>sqrt(sum((x - mean(x))^2) / (length(x) - 1))</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>sqrt(var(x))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 29.01149</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Quartile</li>
</ul>
<p>Quartiles are a set of numbers that split our dataset into quarters (25%). So:</p>
<p>1st Quartile is the number below which 25% of our data is located 2nd Quartile is the number below which 50% of our data is located (Median!) 3rd Quartile is the number below which 75% of our data is located</p>
<ul>
<li>Interquartile Range (IQR)</li>
</ul>
<p>Interquartile range is just the difference between the 3rd Quartile and the 1st Quartile. This means that the middle 50% of the data lies in that range.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Proportion</p></li>
<li><p>Outlier</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Outliers are the unusual observations. In this course we define the outlier to be an observation that lies outside of a range. (Which is quite common for large datasets)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\text{Range} = [Q_1 - 1.5\text{IQR}, Q_3 + 1.5\text{IQR}] = \\
= [Q_1 - 1.5(Q_3 - Q_1), Q_3 + 1.5(Q_3 - Q_1)]
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Boxplot</li>
</ul>
<p>Boxplot is a type of plot for numerical data. It shows the median, 1st and 3rd quartiles, the interquartile range, and outliers into a single plot.</p>
<p>Example in the section below</p>
<ul>
<li><p>R object</p></li>
<li><p>Vector</p></li>
<li><p>Variable Types</p></li>
<li><p>Data Frame / Tibble</p></li>

<li><p>Summary Statistics</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="boxplots" class="section level2">
<h2>Boxplots</h2>
<p>When to use boxplots?</p>
<p>When you want to summarize the distribution of a quantitative (numerical) variable. Boxplots visualize five statistics (minimum, maximum, median, 1 st quartile and 3 rd quartile), while also plotting unusual observations (outliers). You can also use a boxplot to summarize these vales according to a categorical variable of interest.</p>
<p>Example: height of athletes, a continuous variable, can be visualized using a boxplot. You may also want to show how this distribution varies by important categorical variables, such as: sport, country of origin, sex, etc.</p>
<p>How:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load the data as tibble (not necessary)
df &lt;- as_tibble(oly12)

# Make a boxplot:
df %&gt;% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Sport, y = Age)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() +
    theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="STA130F19_files/figure-html/How%20to%20make%20boxplot-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>Limitations: Boxplots are nothing more than visualizations of a couple of nubmers which means they do not give the full picture of your data. If you would like to know about a (better in my opinion) alternative - Violin plots, read the section at the end of this tutorial</p>
</div>
<div id="group-discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Group Discussion</h2>
<p>For Question 1b, you used both histograms and boxplots to visualize your data. Which features were easier/harder to observe from each of the visualizations? In what situations may you want to choose a boxplot over a histogram, or vice versa? Explain.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(&quot;AutoClaims&quot;)
ggplot(data = AutoClaims, aes(x = PAID)) +
    geom_histogram(color = &quot;black&quot;,fill = &quot;gray&quot;, bins = 30) -&gt; p1

ggplot(data = AutoClaims, aes(x = &quot;&quot;, y = PAID)) +
    geom_boxplot() -&gt; p2

<h3>Violin Plots:</h3>

<p>Study skills and students’ satisfaction with their performance positively affect their academic achievement. The current research was carried out to investigate the correlation of study skills with academic achievement among the medical and pharmacy students in 2013. This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 148 students of basic medical sciences and pharmacy through convenience sampling. Data were collected by a valid and reliable questionnaire, consisting of two sections: Demographic information and questions about daily study hours, study skills in six domains, and students’ satisfaction with study skills. Collected data sets were analyzed by SPSS-16 software. In total, 10.9% of students were reported to have favorable study skills. The minimum score was found for preparation for examination domain. Also, a positive correlation was observed between students’ study skills and their Grade Point Average (GPA) of previous term (r=0.269) and satisfaction with study skills (r=0.493). The findings indicated that students’ study skills need to be improved. Given the relationship between study skills and GPA, as an index of academic achievement, and satisfaction, it is necessary to promote the students’ study skills. These skills are suggested to be reinforced, with more emphasis on weaker domains.</p>

<h3>Example 3</h3>
<p><strong>Take 2 minutes to read this over and identify what is good and what is bad </strong></p>
<p>Participants were 477 male, first year students at a liberal arts college. In the week before the start of classes, participants were given two surveys: one of expected college engagement, and the second of video game usage, including a measure of video game addiction. Results suggested that video game addiction is: (a) negatively correlated with expected college engagement, (b) negatively correlated with college grade point average (GPA), even when controlling for high school GPA, and (c) negatively correlated with drug and alcohol violations that occurred during the first year in college.</p>
<p><em>Notes on this example: It doesn’t specifically state why the problem is worth researching, though it is implied as the study focuses on addiction. There is no clear objective; for example: “This study explored the pattern of video game usage and addiction among male college students and examined how video game addiction was related to expectations of college engagement, college GPA, and on-campus drug and alcohol violations.”</em></p>

<h2>Written Evaluation</h2>
<p>Imagine you work as a business analyst for a new cruise company, Fun Cruises. Your CEO has asked you to deliver a written summary of your most interesting research findings on the Titanic (practice problem 1). They want this by the end of the day because they’re meeting a new client tonight for dinner and think this research will be of interest to them. It’s already 3:30 pm and it’s a Friday!</p>
<p>Remember, your CEO is a busy person. They only want the most important information and they don’t want to read more than half a page of text. Use visuals to help get key points across, if you can. The CEO has only limited statistical background, so make sure everything is clear and makes sense! Remember to start with the purpose - your CEO is busy and they may have forgotten exactly what your research was about! Also make sure to include a complete, but concise, summary of the methods, key results, and a conclusion. Remember, you’re the statistics expert and the CEO is counting on you to summary this research!</p>

<h2>Vocab and Concept Review</h2>
<p><strong>How to interpret a p-value?</strong> Misinterpreting p-values is a very common mistake – even one made by senior researchers! In technical terms, a p-value is the probability of obtaining an effect at least as extreme as the one in your sample data, assuming the truth of the null hypothesis. For example, suppose that a vaccine effectiveness study produced a p-value of 0.04. This p- value indicates that if the vaccine had no effect, you’d obtain the observed difference or more in 4% of studies due to random sampling error. Critically, p-values address only one question: how likely are your data, assuming a true null hypothesis? It does not measure support for the alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>What Doesn’t a p-value Mean?</strong> Statistical significance does not mean practical significance. The word “significance” in everyday usage connotes consequence and noteworthiness. Just because you get a low p-value and conclude a difference is statistically significant, doesn’t mean the difference will automatically be important. For example, a large clinical trial investigating a new weight loss drug found that people who took their drug loss 0.1 pounds more over the course of a year compared to those who took their competitor’s drug (p=0.0001). While this is a statistically significant difference, it’s likely not clinically meaningful. Statistically significant just means a result is unlikely due to chance alone!</p>
<p>Other important facts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>P-values are almost never zero - If R shows you an exact zero this means you are not looking at enough digits. You should say something like <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.0001\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(p \approx 0\)</span> never <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>You can never accept the alternative hypothesis. You only reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. This is the most common error in written assignments.</p></li>
<li><p>In the vast majority of cases in statistical analysis you will be using the threshold of $ p = 0.05 $. If <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.05\)</span>, then the chance of observing your outcome due to chance alone was greater than 5% (5 times in 100 or more) under you null hypothesis. In this case, you would fail to reject the null hypothesis and would not accept the alternative hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence of statistically significance is either present or it’s not. Never say that something is “almost” statistically significant.</p></li>

<h3>Question 3d Discussion</h3>
<p>Some people claim that they can tell the difference between Coke or Pepsi in the first sip. A researcher wanting to test the claim that people can distinguish (correctly or incorrectly) between them randomly selected 30 people. He then filled 30 plain white cups with Pepsi and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the drink as Coke or Pepsi. 13 participants correctly identified the drink as Pepsi and the other 17 participants said the drink was Coke. Does this suggest that people can correctly (or incorrectly) tell a difference between the two drinks?

<h2>Additional Resources for coding:</h2>
<p>I mentioned in the last tutorial that the best way to become familiar with how to write code in R is to practice and do some simple data analyses. If you would also like too see what the process from getting data to analysis looks like there is a weekly live coding session called Tidy Tuesdays done by David Robinson. They come out to about 90 minutes, and I think it would be very beneficial to you if you watched one an tried to follow along with some of the commands.

<p>As we can see, the numerical summaries are all pretty much the same - which means the datasets should be fairly similar, right? Let’s look at boxplots first:</p>

<h3>Scenarios</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>A health survey asked 200 individuals aged 20-45 living in Toronto to report the number minutes they exercised last week. Researchers were interested in determining whether the average duration of exercise differed between people who consume alcohol and those who do not consume alcohol. Assume the researchers who conducted this study found that people who drank alcohol exercised, on average, 20 minutes per week. In contrast, people who did not drink alcohol exercised 40 minutes per week, on average. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.249.</p></li>
<li><p>A study was conducted to examine whether the sex of a baby is related to whether or not the baby’s mother smoked while she was pregnant. The researchers used a birth registry of all children born in Ontario in 2018, which included approximately 130,000 births. The researchers found that 4% of mothers reported smoking during pregnancy and 52% of babies born to mothers who smoked were male. In contrast, 51% of babies born to mothers who did not smoke were male. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.50.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on results from a survey of graduates from the University of Toronto, we would like to compare the median salaries of graduates of statistics programs and graduates of computer science programs. 1,000 recent graduates who completed their Bachelor’s degree in the last five years were included in the study; 80% of the respondents were female and 20% were male. Among statistics graduates, the median reported income was $76,000. Among computer science graduates, the median reported income was $84,000. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.014.</p></li>
<li><p>A team of researchers were interested in understanding millennial’s views regarding housing affordability in Toronto. The team interviewed 850 millennials currently living in Toronto. 84% reported that they felt housing prices were unaffordable in the city. Suppose the researchers were interested in testing whether this proportion was different from a study published last year, which found that 92% of millennials reported that housing costs were unaffordable. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.023.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose a drug company was interested in testing a new weight-loss drug. They enrolled 20,000 participants and assigned 10,000 to take their new drug, SlimX, and 10,000 to take a placebo. The researchers found that over 2 months, participants who took SlimX lost, on average, 5 lbs. In comparison, the control group lost 4.5 lbs during the same time.

<h3>This week’s review</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is a data frame? Tibble?</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Frame (DF) / Tibble is an object in R that stores data. We adhere to the tidy principle for DF, that every row is a single observation, and every column contains exactly one variable.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to join data frames? (e.g. need a common variable, often called a key)</li>
</ul>
<p>We can join two data frames as long as they have at least one column in common. For example if we have a DF with your student numbers and presentation grades, and a second DF with your student numbers and Names, I can join the those two to obtain a table containing your names and presentation grades. I would be using your student numbers as the key.</p>

<h3>Ticket out the door questions</h3>
<div id="content-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Content</h4>
<ul>
<li>How to determine Type I and Type II errors?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t! That is why we are so obsessed with the idea of p-values and power in statistics. When conducting a study you will almost never know that you end up with a Type I or Type II error. We are only able to control the error rate by focusing on studies with low p-values and high power.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to calculate p-values?</li>
</ul>
<p>We use simulations. All of the code you wrote that was about repetitions is just to get a p-value for the problem. In short:</p>
<ol start="0" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You conducted a study and obtained some result.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the distribution under the null hypothesis (e.g. probability = 0.5)</p></li>
<li><p>Run a large number of simulations using that distribution</p></li>
<li><p>See in what % of simulations you saw result as extreme or more than your observed test statistic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That is your approximate p-value. The more simulations you run, the closer it is to the actual p-value.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are two-sample and one-sample tests?</li>
</ul>
<p>One sample test: I want to see if observations from a certain group are different from a known constant value. (one group -&gt; one sample)</p>
<p>Two sample test: I want to see if observations from two different groups differ from eachother. (two groups -&gt; two samples)</p>
<ul>
<li>What does $ mean?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will assume you mean in code. It is a simpler way to access columns of a table. data_frame$column is the same as data_frame[[column]] but it is shorter and more readable.</p>
</div>
<div id="organization" class="section level4">
<h4>Organization</h4>
<ul>
<li>Do we need to remember all the R functions from HW?</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be familiar with all major tidyverse functions, but we don’t expect you to write code with no syntax errors on the exam.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we know we typed the correct code in week problems?</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare your code to the solutions posted on quercus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a code reference for R that we can rely on?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can access documentation for each function by typing ?function. I link to some other resources where you can look up ways to do things, but overall the best way is to google and look on stack exchange.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we prepare for the midterm?</li>
</ul>
<p>Review concepts a lot. Skip code examples. Try to match the focus of classes and tutorials - spend the most time making sure you are familiar with things we spent the most time on. (hint: p-values are one of those things)</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the historical average for STA130 ?</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know it’s pretty high (70s), but don’t quote me on that.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the group presentations are marked as a group, what happens if one person performs significantly worse?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="non-course" class="section level4">
<h4>Non-course</h4>
<ul>
<li>Is R more difficult than Python in future study or higher level courses?</li>
</ul>
<p>All statistics courses use R and nothing else. If you take CS courses you will have to learn python pretty well. I found R with tidyverse easier to learn for data analysis, and python easier to learn for more advanced algorithms and more involved coding. In the industry you will have to use both.</p>
<ul>
<li>How familiar should we be with R for future courses?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of statistics courses that use programming, use R. However after STA130 you will not have to learn that much more to be able to handle any other STA course.</p>
<ul>
<li>How long did it take you to be able to write entire functions without looking at documentation?</li>
</ul>
<p>To get good with tidyverse it took me a couple of projects on my own where I did not have any guidance to get decently good. I only became very proficient after working with tidyverse 8 hours a day at work for a few months.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can STA130 help me if I want to study Actuarial Science in the future? How can it help my future workplace?</li>
</ul>
<p>Insurance is very slow to adopt new things. I know that most companies are just starting to adopt R, so proficiency with tidyverse can go a long way. But overall it’s not gonna be that useful. Insurance relies on proprietary software to do most complicated things, and has a lot of legacy systems, and environments. You might have to work with SAS and VBA which as far as programming languages go are VERY unpleasant to use.</p>
<ul>
<li>What role does STA play in our career planning in the future?</li>
</ul>
<p>Depends on what you want to do. Data Science is a rapidly growing field that is still very easy to get into with even basic abilities in R and Python. It also opens the way to more advanced professions and techniques like Machine Learning.</p>

<p>Question 3. You are interested in exploring which characteristics of neighborhoods in Toronto are associated with higher real-estate values – however, you can only find single pieces of information related to each characteristic in separate databases! For example, you’ve found one source of data with information on housing sale prices and another with condo prices. You found other databases with information on the number of parks and schools in the community, and yet another with the number of restaurants and stores in the community. You also found two other databases with information on community crime rates and walkability scores. What type of information would you need to combine all of these databases into one detailed data set that you can use to explore factors associated with real-estate values? How might you define neighbourhoods?</p>

<ul>
<li>Confidence Intervals:</li>
</ul>
<p>The definition of Confidence intervals is subtle and not at all intuitive. The intuitive definition you probably have in mind is actually for something that is called a <em>Credible Interval</em> that comes from a different part of statistics.</p>
<p>Definition:</p>
<p>Purpose: Obtain an estimate the parameter that reflects sampling variability.</p>
<p>Check that they make sense - If you are looking at CI for probability make sure it is inside the <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> interval.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of bootstrapping is to estimate the sampling distribution and extract some insight from it, for example confidence intervals for a parameter of choice.</p>
<p>There are many different versions of bootstrapping. We are using <em>percentile</em> <em>bootstrapping</em> which works best for large samples and when the underlying distribution is symmetric and continuous.</p>
<p>You will see other versions of bootstrapping in upper year statistics classes.</p>

<h2>Ticket out the Door</h2>
<div id="course-related" class="section level3">
<h3>Course Related</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can you talk about identifying when a tibble is tidy ? (I am not 100% sure this was the question)</li>
</ul>
<p>All you need to make sure of is that there is exactly one observation per row and one variable per column.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between test statistic and p-value ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Test statistic is the value you observed in your study. For example this would be the woman identifying 11/12 parkinsons people correctly. Your test statistic is then 11/12. Your p-value is the probability of seeing a test statistic as extreme or more under the null hypothesis.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the most difficult concept that we have learned so far that will trip up the students ?</li>
</ul>
<p>P-values, Confidence intervals, pretty much anything with a very precise definition. Also the difference between sampling and data distributions.</p>
</div>
<div id="organization-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li>What can I improve if the lectures feel overwhelming? Too much information in too little time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should attempt to make as good notes as possible, and then review them a lot. Make sure you note down all things you did not understand and make a lsit with definitions later sort of like I do here on the website.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the format of the midterm?</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple choice questions, Filling in blanks, Short written questions.</p>
<p>Filling in the blanks is most likely going to be code.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to do well on the midterm?</li>
</ul>
<p>Review important concepts. Make sure you are very comfortable with the definitions, do a basic review of how we do things. How do we estimate p-values? How do we define hypotheses? Also do past midterms if you have access to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will we have a review package?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to my knowledge. Making a review package is probably the best method of studying for courses.</p>
<ul>
<li>I heard Dr White’s class avg was 68% last year and Dr Moon’s was 75%, is this real?</li>
</ul>
<p>Nope.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will writing R code be on the exam?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will not be expected to write perfect quality code on the exam. You might be asked to fill in some blanks or write simple code but we don’t expect you to memorize the syntax of functions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you go over more midterm stuff in tutorial?</li>
</ul>
<p>I can try but I have to adhere to the plan with discussions and your written activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-course-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-Course</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is it true that CS students make more money that STA students.</li>
</ul>
<p>Short answer: On average, yes.</p>
<p>Long answer: Until this year Statistics program did not have any requirements to enter so students that did not make it into computer science became stats majors. We also have a significantly larger number of people that graduate and go to work in government positions (Stats Canada) which pay less. If you want to make a lot of money stats is just as good of a choice as CS in my opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between a stats major and data science specialist?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stats major / specialist programs will be focusing more on the theory side with a smaller applied component, but also allows you to take pretty much any course you want. Data Science is more structured, has a better name in terms of employment, but has less freedom. It’s also a lot harder to get in to.</p>

<li><p>If you and your partner both applied the same bootstrap sampling method to the same data, do you expect that you both arrive at the same estimate and CI? What are some factors that you would need to consider (and hold constant) to ensure that you both arrived at the same answer?</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss question 1d from the practice problem set. Indicate whether or not each of the following statements is a correct interpretation of the confidence interval constructed in 1c) and justify your answers.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>We are 95% confident that between 56% and 73% of kissing couples in this sample tilt their head to the right when they kiss.</p></li>
<li><p>We are 95% confident that between 56% and 73% of all kissing couples in the population tilt their head to the right when they kiss.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a 95% chance that between 56% and 73% of all kissing couples in the population tilt their head to the right when they kiss.</p></li>
<li><p>If we considered many random samples of 124 couples, and calculated 95% confidence intervals for each sample, 95% of these confidence intervals will include the true proportion of kissing couples in the population who tilt their heads to the right when they kiss.</p></li>

<h2>Poster Project</h2>
<p>Now it’s time for you guys to start planning what you will do in for your poster project. Things you should talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The research question(s) they are interested in investigating.</li>
</ul>
<p>What is something that the Toronto Police might be interested in knowing?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any interesting visualizations. Remember, these should be interesting and useful for the audience. They should also be appropriately labelled and should stand alone (explain what stand alone means so all students are on the same page; e.g. information title, axes, and a brief sentence or two explaining the main take away messages)</p></li>
<li><p>Think about whether they will need to join datasets to answer their research question. They are able to use additional sources of data, if they like – and if relevant to their research question. (This would be considered in the WOW factor category!)</p></li>
<li><p>What will each group member be responsible for?</p></li>
<li><p>How often will you meet?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: You are not committed to this plan and it can change as you learn new methods. This activity is to get you thinking about the project early on. If you wait until after reading week you will be very rushed to complete the project and it will likely end up not being very good.</p>
<p>Aspects to consider in your research plan:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The research question(s)</p></li>
<li><p>The hypotheses</p></li>
<li><p>Aims/objectives</p></li>
<li><p>Research design: data, methods, visualizations, etc.</p></li>

<div id="vocab-4" class="section level2">
<h2>Vocab:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Confusion Matrices - TP, FP, TN, FN</p>
<ul>
<li><p>TP - True positive = Predicted to be A and is A</p></li>
<li><p>FP - False positive = Predicted to be A but is B</p></li>
<li><p>TN - True Negative = Predicted to be B and is B</p></li>
<li><p>FN - False Negative = Predicted to be B but is A</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Overall there are two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>(True / False) = Was the prediction correct?</p></li>
<li><p>(Positive / Negative) = What was the prediction?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There are a lot of derivative terms coming from the 4 entries to the confusion matrix. The main ones are :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>TPR - True Positive Rate, in other words what proportion of all positives are the true positives. This is also called Sensitivity and Recall. (Yes, you should know all 3 names)</p></li>
<li><p>FPR - False Positive Rate, same as above except False positives.</p></li>
<li><p>TNR - True Negative Rate, i.e. what proportion of all predicted as negative are actually negative. This is also called Specificity. (Yes, you should know both names)</p></li>
<li><p>Accuracy - What proportion of things was predicted correctly</p></li>
<li><p>PPV - positive predictive value. It’s the number of true positives divided by the number of predicted positives. This is usually called Precision.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prediction</p></li>
<li><p>Classification - One of broadly speaking two types of main tasks in prediction we try to assign a group belonging to each datapoint / object.</p></li>
<li><p>ROC - Receiver Operating Characteristic curve is the curve that shows a tradeoff for your model between Sensitivity (TPR) and Specificity (TNR). Because we usually give the class prediction in terms of “probability” we can design a cut off at different thresholds. I.e. we only predict positive if the model is 50% or more confident it is positive (and 100% - 50% = 50% or less confident it is negative). As we vary that threshold the TPR and TNR will change resulting in a curve.</p></li>

<div id="group-discussions-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Group Discussions</h2>
<p>Warmup question to everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can you think of any real-life examples where you may want to develop a classification tree?</li>
</ul>
<p>In Groups:</p>
<p><em>Question 1:</em></p>
<p>Suppose you developed a classification tree to diagnosis whether or not somebody has Disease X, which is a very serious and life-threatening illness if left untreated. The overall accuracy of your tree was 77%; false-positive rate was 32%; and false-negative rate: 7.9%. Suppose that your colleague also created a classifier for the same purpose. Its overall accuracy is 81%; false-positive rate is 6.4%; and false-negative rate is 39%. Explain which of these two classifiers you would prefer to use to diagnosis Disease X.</p>
<p><em>Question 2:</em></p>
<p>Suppose you developed a classification tree only to later discover that the values for one of your covariates is missing for a number of observations. Can you use the classification tree you built to make a prediction for these individuals? Explain.</p>
<p><em>Question 3:</em></p>
<p>Imagine you were interested in making a classifier to predict what movie somebody would be most interested in. To do this, you first gathered data from a sample of your closest friends. You validated and tested your classifier using different subsets of this data. Now you wish you use your classifier to predict which movie Dr. Moon/ White, your TA, your parents, etc. would like. How well do you think your classifier will perform in each of these cases?</p>

<div id="presentations" class="section level2">
<h2>Presentations:</h2>
<p>Things to keep inmind:</p>
<p><em>Content:</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the main message you want to get across?</p></li>
<li><p>Create an (organized) outline of your presentation</p></li>
<li><p>Define terms early</p></li>
<li><p>Make clear transitions between parts of your presentation</p></li>
<li><p>Make your data/ figures meaningful</p></li>
<li><p>Summarize</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Delivery:</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Be confident, make eye contact and avoid reading</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid filler words – “ummm”, “like”, “you know”</p></li>
<li><p>Speak slowly and it’s ok to pause (and breathe!)</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to enunciate all the parts of each word</p></li>
<li><p>Practice! Practice! Practice!</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Presentation Topics:</em></p>
<p><em>Topic 1:</em></p>
<p>Explain how to make a ROC curve and the type of information it provides.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Based on the ROC curves you created for Practice Problem 4c, describe the accuracy of each of the two trees.</p></li>
<li><p>Does this fit your expectations based on the description of each classifier?</p></li>
<li><p>Which ROC curve would you prefer to classify your spam mail?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Topic 2:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Explain what a confusion matrix is and how each cell is calculated.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the confusion matrix you calculated in question 1d to answer the followingquestions: What percentage of countries with “good life expectancy” that were classifiedas having such actually had “good” life expectancy according to the majority rules cutpoint (i.e., 50%) based on each of the two classifiers?</p></li>
<li><p>What are other terms used to describe the percentages you calculated above?</p></li>
<li><p>How do the two classifiers compare? Does this fit your expectations based on the description of each classifier?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Topic 3:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Summarize the classification tree from Practice Problem 1b. Make sure to include at least the following points: how the splits on each variable were selected, how a new observation would be predicted by this classification tree.</p></li>
<li><p>In part c, you considered more factors. Do you think there may be other important factors to consider? Explain how including these might impact the accuracy of your tree.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="organization-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>I will walk around and get your poster groups into a table.</p>
</div>
<div id="correction" class="section level2">
<h2>Correction:</h2>
<p>I realized only when asking questions that I put up the wrong formula on the board for TPR, it was PPV instead. Below are the correct formulas:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
TPR = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \frac{TP}{P} = \frac{TP}{\text{Actually Positive}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Which is just the proportion of all things positive that we actually predicted to be positive. This is in contrast to the PPV:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
PPV = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{TP}{\text{Predicted Positive}}
\]</span></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix">wikipedia article</a> on the confusion matrix is quite good at explaining this and how to compute it.</p>
