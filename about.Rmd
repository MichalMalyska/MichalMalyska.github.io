I'm currently a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto.
My - soon to be completed - B.Sc is a specialist degree in statistics
(for other universities this would qualify as a double major in applied
statistics and theoretical statistics)

In the past I've worked at Intact Financial on the Belairdirect team,
and at Deloitte Canada on the Actuarial, Rewards & Analytics team, focusing
on analytics and predictive modelling.

Throughout my degree, I've focused on taking as many stats and math
courses that pertained to modelling, machine learning and statstical
analysis as I could.
